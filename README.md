# HackerRank

This is simply a place for me to store my solutions to HackerRank puzzles for my own future reference.

These are *raw* solutions and aren't necessarily intended to be run, compiled, or interpreted on their own (i.e. outside the HackerRank environment). (This is especially given I did some with Java 7 and some with Java 8, and probably did some with Python 2 and some with Python 3.)
